# VidFlix
Netflix-like app that will allow videos on a computer to be viewed by other devices connected to the network.
It can be for example your phone, your guest's phone or another laptop.

It simply works by making all MP4 videos from directories you choose, available on a web page using HTML5 \<video> tag.

It is built for intuitively simplifying the life by making large video content portable within a local area network,
which would otherwise be too large to put on mobile devices. It presents the videos on a webpage with a responsive Bootstrap design to provide a beautiful user experience for different kinds of devices.
